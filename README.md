# Hello
What kind of app is this? This is a social network created as part of the ReactJS course - the way of the samurai (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcvhF2Wqh7DNVy1OCUpG3i5lyxyBWhGZ8 ). This course is provided in JavaScript, but I did it in TypeScript.

In this project I use the following libraries:
- **axios** 
- **classnames**
- **jest**
- **react** and **@types/react**
- **react-dom** and **@types/react-dom**
- **react-redux** and **@types/react-redux**
- **react-router-dom** and **@types/react-router-dom**
- **react-scripts** 
- **redux**
- **redux-form** and **@types/redux-form**
- **redux-thunk**
- **reselect**
- **typescript** 
- **uuid** and **@types/uuid**

After git clone 'link' install all dependencies from package.json:
### `yarn`
Project launch:
### `yarn start`
